**Elevator Simulator Project**

 This project models a real world Elevator system. It is capable responding to passengers requesting for it, dropping
 them off and changing direction when completing cyclea

*All you need is run the jar file and you are set to using our Elevator*

## Notes

1. The elevator holds a maximum of 10 passengers, if you are unfortunate and get left out NO WORRIES. You will
get picked up once the passengers are evacuated at the first floor.

2. You can only go to the first floor if you boarded from a floor different than the first floor. The development 
is working on getting you the flexibility to go anywhere
